## Project Overview

The **Formula 1 Track Analysis and 2D Visualization** project provides users with an interactive way to visualize Formula 1 race circuits. The project primarily focuses on analyzing various track features, including turn geometries, straight sections, and elevation changes, through **2D visualizations**. By utilizing publicly available track data and race telemetry, the project provides a comprehensive understanding of how track features impact race performance and strategies.

In addition, the project can be expanded to support **3D visualization** using the Plotly library, which would allow users to visualize elevation changes more effectively and better understand how track gradients affect car dynamics.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks**:
  - **Data Visualization**:
    - **Matplotlib**: For 2D plotting of the track layouts and telemetry data.
    - **Plotly** (for potential 3D): Used for creating interactive 3D visualizations.
  - **Data Handling**:
    - **Pandas**: For handling race data and track coordinates.
    - **NumPy**: For numerical operations and data manipulation.
  - **F1 Data Source**:
    - **FastF1**: A Python package to retrieve and process telemetry data from Formula 1 races.

## Methodology

### 1. Track Data Collection
- **Data Source**: We used the **FastF1** package to extract race telemetry data, including car speeds, braking points, and track coordinates (x, y positions).
- **Track Coordinates**: The track layout is plotted based on latitude and longitude or XY-coordinate data retrieved from the telemetry.

### 2. 2D Visualization
- **Matplotlib**: The primary visualization tool used in this project. We plot the track layouts in **2D** to allow users to explore:
  - **Track Layout**: Visualizes the basic outline of the track, including straights and curves.
  - **Corners and Straights**: Identifies key track elements and how drivers handle them.
  - **Telemetry Overlay**: Users can overlay telemetry data, such as speed, acceleration, and braking points, over the track layout to analyze driver behavior in specific sections.
  
- **Elevation Profiles**: By plotting the elevation along the length of the track (if elevation data is available), users can study how changes in elevation impact driving techniques and strategies.

### 3. Potential 3D Visualization
The 2D visualization provides detailed track insights, but **elevation changes** and track gradients could be visualized more intuitively using 3D visualization. Here's how we plan to extend the project to 3D:

- **Plotly for 3D Visualization**:
  - **Interactive 3D Plots**: By integrating **Plotly**, the project could represent tracks in **three dimensions**, showing height (elevation) alongside the XY layout of the track.
  - **Dynamic Views**: Plotly’s 3D visualization would allow users to rotate and zoom, providing a better understanding of elevation changes and their effects on car handling.
  - **Elevation Data**: The track’s elevation data can be plotted to show not just flat layouts but how the vertical profile affects races, including uphill climbs and downhill descents.

This potential 3D enhancement would provide a deeper insight into how elevation plays a crucial role in racing strategy, tire wear, and car dynamics on various tracks.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- A basic understanding of Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly (optional for 3D visualization)

### Steps to Install
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/f1-track-analysis.git
   cd f1-track-analysis
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
   env\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download Race Data Using FastF1**:
   Ensure you have FastF1 installed and fetch race data from the current or previous seasons.
   ```python
   import fastf1
   session = fastf1.get_session(2023, 'Monaco', 'Q')
   session.load()
   ```

5. **Run the Analysis**:
   Execute the analysis scripts to visualize the tracks.
   ```bash
   python track_visualization.py
   ```

## Usage

- After setting up the environment, you can run the Python script to generate **2D visualizations** of the selected tracks.
- You can experiment with different tracks by altering the race session and track information in the FastF1 retrieval script.
  
To add **3D visualization**, modify the script to use Plotly for creating 3D graphs by importing the necessary libraries and visualizing the track with elevation data.

## Future Improvements

- **3D Visualization**: As discussed earlier, expanding this project into 3D using Plotly would provide a richer understanding of the track’s elevation changes.
- **Telemetry Data Enhancement**: Incorporating more telemetry data layers, such as tire wear, fuel consumption, and DRS usage, to further analyze race strategy.
- **Driver Comparisons**: Enable users to compare multiple drivers on the same track with overlaid telemetry data for more detailed analysis.
- **Live Data Integration**: Fetch and analyze live race data in real-time to dynamically update track visualizations.
